        <h2>Turnabout - Haiku</h2>
        <i>The blade slashes through</i><br />
        <i>Katana glistening red</i><br />
        <i>The grapefruit is sliced</i>
      </div>
      <p>
        I was inspired to write that poem after reading haikus in one of my
        literature courses. The title takes its inspiration from the
        <cite>Ace Attorney</cite> Gameboy series.

      <h2>My personal interests</h2>
      <p>
        One of my most sincere and enduring interests has been the study of the
        Spanish language.<br />
        Like many other Mormons, I signed up to represent the church as a
        missionary, and they told<br />
        me I would be teaching our message in the Spanish language. By the end
        of my 2-year tenure as a <br />
        missionary, I was hooked on Hispanic Linguistics; it became an obsession
        for the better part of a <br />
        decade, and though I have other focuses these days, the flame will never
        die out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another interest of mine is the 1993 Dodge Cummins 3/4 ton pickup truck.
        What especially captures <br />
        my attention is the sheer, raw simplicity of the powertrain. The engine
        doesn't need <i>any</i> <br />
        electricity to run. If you can get it spinning (clutch-bump), it will
        run. The other aspect of the <br />
        vehicle that I love is how long-lived the engine is. It is normal for
        the Cummins 6BT to last for <br />
        750,000 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
        My final significant interest could be called "manufactured". I didn't
        initially care for software, <br />
        and in fact I began to study it for financial reason (I watned the
        paycheck). However as I dove deeper <br />
        into the subversive world of web development, as well as the intricate
        field of software optimization, <br />
        I discovered a certain power to software that was alluring. I never
        realized that computers were initially <br />
        meant to be owned and operated by the user, not borrowed from the
        manufacturer like they are nowadays.
